v6
--
(6.1) Removed verbose logging by default.  Reduced total log file size.
(6.1) Updated tool tip to make SD2SNES state less ambiguous.
Fixed hookless patch region so it doesn't crash SNES when hook is enabled.
Added websocket connectivity information.
Added Name command to identify websocket app.
Added currentRom and currentFeature strings to Info command.
Added slightly faster mirror for first $7800 of WRAM.

v5
--
(5.1) Added back save_state patch button checks based on game type.
(5.1) Fixed crash when exiting tool tray app when dialog box is open for AutoUpdate.
(5.1) Added AppVersion command.
(5.1) Removed flushing log file on every command by default.  Enable in usb2snes.exe.config.
Fixed (workaround) stalls with long transfers by using 512B packet size.
Added NMI-based hookless code execution region @ $2C00-$2FFF
Added basic server log file.
Updated save state patch to support external saves and simplify button detection code.

v4
--
(4.2) Added ZeldaHUD
(4.2) Fixed non-vector multiple address GET/PUT operations by rewriting server handlers.
(4.1) Removed some websocket debug output.
Fixed NMI hook patches so they are persistant and don't conflict with the menu.
Updated save_state patch to support memory load/save trigger.
Added (experimental) update feature.

v3
--
(3.1) Fixed InputViewer hardcoded COM port.
(3.1) Cleaned up application listing feature.  Adding an app now requires making a apps/<directory> (corresponds to displayed app name) and placing an executable inside of it.
Replaced usb2snes file viewer program with unified usb2snes tray app.  It supports a websockets based interface on localhost:8080 which enables multiple clients to talk to one or more SD2SNES devices over USB.
Added input viewer.
Fixed several bugs in the firmware.

v2
--
Fixed read data corruption bug.
Fixed gamepad data read hack.

v1
--
Updated versioning system to use v# format.
Added info command.

v0.66
-----
Fixed several bugs with NORESP and vector operations.
Reverted CX4 and MSU enabled FPGA file to 0.1.7e.

v0.65
-----
Fixed save state to not enable PPU until after PPU alignment.  Fixes some momentary graphics glitches on load.
Fixed many timing and questionable SNES bus loading statements in the FPGA.
Added support for 64B data block sizes and no responses based on flag.
Added support for 64B vector VGET/VPUT commands.
Removed MSU support from base firmware.
Removed ZeldaHUD.
Changed save to SD code to compute CRC across multiple iterations to leave time for USB on large SaveRAM images.

v0.6
----
Fixed DMA problem introduced in previous version's state.
Updated ZeldaHUD to ignore exceptions on COM port device queries.
Added DMA engine and spin loop logic.  Changed save states to use DMA engine.
Added reset/menu and rearranged buttons.
Fixed more timeouts.

v0.5
----
Fixed (workaround) for EXE/RESET races seen in windows10.
Added context saving state machine.
Added simple RAM viewer.

v0.4
----
Fixed more timeouts due to disconnect problems.  There are still more left to fix.  E.g. pulling the cable out typically requires a reboot of the snes and app.
Added preliminary USB/NET memory region support.  Work in progress.
Fixed (workaround) problem where querying certain COM devices results in an exception.  The exception is now discarded.

v0.3
----
Fixed more timeouts due to collisions with other interrupts in FW.  MSU is still buggy.
Added Write-Only register snooping to enable save-stating.
Added basic IPS patch and state managing support.  Included save_state IPS patch.

v0.2
----
Added more features to file transfer program.
Added hack for SRAM reads to workaround timeout problems.

v0.1
----
Rewrote sd2snes usb support.
Added upload/delete/rename functionality.
Fixed problems with boot and download.
